							<h2 class="major">Blockchain with a Purpose</h2>
							<p>In our global world today, it is impossible if unproductive to separate technology from human life. What’s more, mankind’s dependence on technology has made it very hard on anyone to think that the world in general, and the economic and financial worlds in particular, will continue to go the way they did in a pre-technological world.
								<br>
								People use technology to connect and communicate on a personal as well as business levels; people use technology to travel, to teach and learn, to live in comfort, to cure and save lives, and to do business and politics in much more practical, swift and effective ways. Technology has impacted agriculture and the food chain, it has impacted the economy, and it has impacted the environment, though not always in good ways. Ultimately, it has impacted people and society as a whole. And although it is almost impossible to assess every single change in people, society and the environment, we know for sure that technology has had a huge impact on them in all aspects of everyday life and, more crucially, we know that its impact on the future of humanity will probably be exponentially greater.
								<br>
								<b>Horyou SA’s HToken is just about that; it is Blockchain with a purpose.</b>
